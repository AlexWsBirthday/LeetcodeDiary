# Hi! Welcome to my Algorithm Library.

Using this repository as a storage for my notes and study material, this algorithm library/glossary is my method at becoming more familiar with the patterns and syntax seen in leetcode solutions. Using the algorithm library, I'm taking the time to deeply understand the basis of different kinds solutions specific to what certain problems are asking of me.

## The Goal

By becoming familiar with these frequently seen patterns in leetcode problems, I'll be cutting down the time I spend on coming up with a brute force solution when solving a problem from scratch. That way, I can **focus more on optimizing my solutions.**
