# [Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=rab78cw1)

## Problem

`Given a string s, return the longest palindromic substring in s.`

## Example

It looks like we first have to figure out:

1. Whether a string is structured the same when it's reversed

- **IF TRUE** - check its length, compare it to max length.

- **IF FALSE** - remove (unshift? )

## Data Structures

## Algorithm (Higher Level)

## Code

```js

```
